# My Awesome Keyboard
My first keyboard was a full 100% membrane keyboard. but it was too big and hinder my mouse movement. and then I tried a TKL keyboard and it still hinder my mouse movement. So I try a 60% keyboard to save a lot of space on my desk, but I realize I need a dedicated arrow key so bad. I also have multiple device, so I need a wireless keyboard so much to switch between device. So I try 75%(keychron k2) but I don't need function key that much. So I try a 65% keyboard and that's perfectly fit what I need. But there is no keyboard that have the feature that I want, So I make it myself. And all my keyboard now is 65%, with split spacebar, rotary encoder, oled, rgb underglow and wireless.

## QSplit

The first time I enter the world of mechanical keyboard. I want to make my own version of split keyboard. I want a quefrency like layout with oled and encoder. so I come up with this design. It is a handwired keyboard using pro micro on the both halves. The case is using sandwich acrylic.

## QSplit rev2

I realize I don't need the macro key on the left side. So I replace it with dedicated encoder. potentio slide and a bigger oled display. This one using a mixed board. the left side using Teensy++ 2.0 and the right side is using pro micro. with i2c communication.

I also make a trackpoint for this keyboard

## Marvelous65
I really want something like [luantty2's candy ble](https://github.com/luantty2/nRF52840-instruction) but in 65%. I never design and make a pcb before and I have little knowledge in pcb design. But the community encourage me to design a pcb. they say it is easy. So I learn to make a PCB using [ai03's guide](https://wiki.ai03.com/). and here it is my proud design. I call it marvelous65.
